# Todo-List Webapp

## Description

This project is a Todo-List Webapp that empowers users to organize tasks efficiently. Users can create different projects, each containing a list of todos. A todo comprises a name, a checkbox indicating completion status, a due date, a description, and two action buttons for deletion and editing.

## Features

- **Projects:** Create and delete projects as needed.
- **Todos:** Add, edit, and delete todos within each project.
- **Special Projects:**
  - **Inbox:** View all todos from all projects.
  - **Day:** View todos due today across all projects.
  - **Week:** View all todos due in the current week across projects.

## Persistence

The website utilizes `localStorage` to save user changes. This means that even if you close the browser and reopen it, your data will persist.
